OOPS in python:

Object oriented programming.
it is one of the popular and sucessfull approch to solve any problem by creating some relationship between the modules.
the main purpose of this concept is to achive the process of reusabilty.

we mainly write the business logics inside a class.

in python we can write code in different ways, but writting code implementing oops is always a definite one.

to access the content of a class we must need to define an object

object is called as an instance of a class.
object have two characteristics
	* attributes
	* behaviour

attributes nothing but variables
behaviour is nothing but methods.

how to create a class in python

syntax:

class ClassName:
  // logic

  employeename= 'prathap'

here employeename is called class attribute( variable)

  def addDetails():

	print("adding details to the database")

// add details is called as behaviour


inside a class if we want to access the class level details, we must use the keyword called "self"

self is used to represent the properties of a current class


When we write a logic in oops, and if we want to send data to the class level variable, we must need a place holder.

that place holder is called as "constructor"

in python to send data to the class we use construtor

in python constructor will be defined as __ini__()

()---- is place holder to send data to the classmemebers.


syntax of a constructor is 


	def __init__():

		//write a logic here

Note:
if we dont have a variable at the classlevel, we can create a variable inside a constructor by using self keyword.

this variable can be used at any place


How constructor will work?

when ever we create an object to a class, automatically the constructor will get triggered.

when the constructor is being triggered it will check teh number of arguments are getting matched or not.

if any arguments are missed then it will throw an exception.
