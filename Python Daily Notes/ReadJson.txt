How to work with json data?

in python we have a inbuilt module called json

using this module we can read/write a json files

in python using json module, there are4 methods available

		* load
		* loads
		* dump
		* dumps

load-- this method is used to read the json file data

loads--- this method is used to convert the python json string into json object

dump--- this method is used to write the json data on a physical file

dumps-- this method is used to print the data in json format on the console




json is called java script object notation

it looks as same as dict

from the dict if we want to get the data, we must retrive by using the key
