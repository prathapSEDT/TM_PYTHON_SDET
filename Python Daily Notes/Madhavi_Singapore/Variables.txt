variables:

variables are called as memeory holders to store the values in the program

basically there will be  a mai memory block available where your python is installed.

we take that as working memeory location



when ever i create a variable . based on the type of data a memory block will be created

when ever i want to get the value of a variable i should call it by the name of the variable.

how to create a variable in python:

in other programming languages, we have datatypes, but in python we wont have any datatyes we consider every thing as an object.

based on the data assignment, the memory block will be created with the respective size.

syntax:

variableName=someValue

to see the out put:

in python we use a method called print(variablename)

to print the descriptive output , we use strings 

string are also called as text data

strings are represented in single quotes,triple quotes, double quotes
