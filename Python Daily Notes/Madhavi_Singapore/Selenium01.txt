identification of elements in selenium


elements can be identified by using locators like

	* id
	* name
	* xpath
	* css
	* tagname
	* classname
	* linktext
	* partial link text


in selenium to identify any element we must use DOM structure

DOM stand for document object model.

in html we have different webcontrols

1.link:
tml tag for the link is <a>...</a>

<a>--- html tag
..... >> innertext or innerHTML

if we find any tag having open and close <></>=== we call it as paired html tags


when you found a link on the webapplication, you can identify it by a locator called "linktext"

2.Radio Button:
we can choose only one option

<input type="radio">----

when ever you found input tag, it is called as a unpaired html tag


identify the element with id:

<input type="radio" value="M" id="gender-male" name="Gender">


in this tag

htmltag-----input

type and value ,id name are called as attributes


in selenium to identify the elements by id.

driver.find_element_by_id("id value")
