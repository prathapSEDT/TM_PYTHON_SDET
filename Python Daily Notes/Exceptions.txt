Exception Handling:

If there is weired behaviour on the code logic we called it as an exception

when there is an exception raised the process of execution will be terminated abnormally.

suppose i tried to read a file but unfortunate there is no file available.

after reading the file i need to publisg my results.


when there is no file available, if we start executing the script, python will raise an exception and it will terminate the process abnormally.
so that you can not process to print the results.

now either exception is raised or not no matter i need to proceeed further and go ahead to publish the results. in order to do this we need to control the exception smartly in python programming using exception handling concept.


in python exception handling can be achived using 

	try:

	except:

	finally:


try is a block where we need to write the risky code

except is the block which can catch any kindo f execption , where user need to write the controlling logic for the raised execption.

finally block is the block where we need to write the logic for the smooth clousere where this block will execute 100% ir-respective of exception that is raised.
