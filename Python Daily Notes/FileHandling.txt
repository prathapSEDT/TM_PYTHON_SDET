File Handling:

File handling is one of the of ,ost importamt aspect in any programming language.

in python , the key funtion we used is called "open()"

this ope method will take exactly two arguments in place


1.filepath
2.mode of file 

	* r - read --- only to read no other operation allowed, error when no file is availble
	* a - append --- add data to the existing file, error if no file exist
	* w - write --- open the file write, if no file exist create new file, else overwrite
	* x - create --- create a new raise error if the file is already exist

	* t--- text mode 
	* b ---- binary


can we combine two modes at a time say like i would like to work on a file where i can do write and read operation, is that possible?

Yes, by keeping as r+
